- paragraph: Welcome to my GitHub IO page. I'm a self-driven software and test engineer with a strong passion for learning and problem-solving, recently diving deep into Python and Selenium Webdriver to expand my automation and development skillset. With hands-on experience contributing to projects for major companies like Wayfair and NEXT, I bring both technical expertise and an eagerness to grow. I'm now looking for my next venture—ideally with a forward-thinking team where I can continue to evolve and make meaningful impact. My core development experience lies in PHP, with an emphasis on the Symfony and Laravel frameworks. I've built and maintained robust backend systems and have consistently contributed to high-impact projects. In addition to my full stack development experience, I have a deep interest in automation and have developed significant proficiency with Cypress. I was instrumental in building out my current companies Cypress test suite — personally contributing 55% of the total coverage — dramatically improving testing reliability and deployment confidence across teams.

- paragraph: I have worked with some big named brand companies across the years providing various services. And with this, my roles often involved working closely with company executives and stakeholders to translate business needs into actionable technical outcomes. I’ve produced product specifications, generated analytics reports, and helped inform decision-making with clear, data-driven insights. Beyond technical contributions, I’ve created marketing copy and designed images for websites, supporting e-commerce strategies with content tailored to drive engagement and sales. This blend of technical and business-facing experience makes me confident in communicating across all levels of an organization and delivering value beyond just code. Most recently, I have also worked with government bodies, assisting in the retention and distribution of information through my contributions to a customisable content management system product.
